# HaloTime Notebook README

## Overview
This notebook, "HaloTime.ipynb," is focused on exploring a modified version of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of white holes, a theoretical concept in general relativity. It is structured into several sections, each designed to build upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive study of the topic.

## Sections

### Introduction
- Purpose: Investigating white holes using a modified Schwarzschild metric.
- Importance: Expands our understanding of theoretical entities in general relativity.

### Theoretical Background
- Discusses the standard Schwarzschild metric as a solution to Einstein's field equations.
- Introduces white holes and their theoretical significance.

### Mathematical Foundation
- Aim: To set up the mathematical framework for exploration.
- Includes: Definition of physical constants and the modified Schwarzschild metric tensor.
- Note: There's an error in the code related to an undefined term 'Matrix'. This needs correction for proper functioning.

### Numerical Simulations and Analysis
- Objective: To implement numerical simulations for analyzing particle trajectories and light paths.
- Focus: Understanding the effects of the modified time component on spacetime geometry and potential observational signatures.

## Usage and Requirements
To utilize this notebook effectively:
- Correct the error in the Mathematical Foundation section.
- Familiarity with general relativity, Schwarzschild metrics, and white holes is beneficial.
- Numerical simulation knowledge is required for the final section.

## Contributions
This notebook is open for contributions. Interested individuals can improve the simulations, rectify errors, or enhance the theoretical discussions.
